        <h2>FOOTBALL</h2>
        <p>Association football, more commonly known as simply football or soccer,<sup>[a]</sup> is a team sport played
            with
            a
            spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million players in over
            200
            countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular
            field
            called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score more goals than the opposition by
            moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal, usually within a time frame of 90 or more
            minutes.
